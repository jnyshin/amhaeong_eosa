# Amhaeong-Eosa (암행어사)
Amhaeong-Eosa is an tourism service proposal which specifically targets Seoul, Republic of Korea. <br>
This proposal was submitted to Idea Contest for Encouraging Tourism in Seoul (University Students Only) hosted by Korea Tourism Office, and won Encouragement Award. (장려상) <br>

### Problem Statement
When people search for places to visit, they usually look for reviews from previous visitors. However, since the reviews can be subjective, people have hard time distinguising whether the reviews were sponsored (advertisement) or from real experience. These fake informations may not provide the best experience and not satisfy people. If so, they will not visit the place again and the place will loose its value as tourist destination. 

Seoul is the capital of Republic of Korea and tourism is huge part of this city's economy. In other words, Seoul is not free from the problem of fake informations as well. Even Koreans (like myself) have trouble to find a really good place to visit in Seoul so it will be more harder for foreign visitors. How can this problem be solved?   

### Solution
We started by asking this question to ourselves, "What if there is a platform where users can get valid, transparant informations only?". The valid and transparant informations could be provided by Korea Tourism Organization. Thus we came up with an idea of a friendly service that users can access them easily. 

Our team borrowed concept of the royal secret inspector in Joseon era (1392 ~ 1897), who traveled every town of Korea and checked how people lived. They carried a metal tablet, mapae, with horse picture as their identification method. The number of horses in the mapae represented experienced level of the inspector. Our team applied this concept to our application's UI.

### Functions
1) Users can view the map of Seoul with a selected category. The tourist spots are divided into four cateogires: foods, parks, exhibitions/museums, and historical sites.
2) The map in home page is divided into districts of Seoul. The districts will be colored if the user visits all places in the district. 
3) Users can post pictures and comments about places they visited. 
4) Based on numbers of places users visited, their levels go up. As they get higher level, more free coupons and discounts to enterence fee are provided. The levels are described with mapae that Amhaeng-Eosas carried. 
5) Users can check on-going events in Seoul 


### Note 
Amhaeng-Eosa was only developed up to UI/UX, since this application was developed for this idea contest only. Also, eue to the purpose of this project the documents are available in Korean only.
